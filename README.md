# Utility Runner
Team Chroma GGJ updated to Godot 3.0

# Instructions

## Goal

Be the first team to wire all the poles.


## 2 Player

One player uses Left Trigger and Right Trigger to drive truck forward and backward

Other uses Left Joy Stick and A to raise boom / perform actions.


## 1 Player

One player uses Left Trigger and Right Trigger to drive truck forward and backward

Same player uses Left Joy Stick and A to raise boom / perform actions.


## Player Actions

* Punch opposing players sending them flying and if they are attaching wire it will stop the process - truck momentum matters
* Switch controls on back of opponent truck to temporarily disable their truck
* Hold A to attach wire to pole (the whole goal)

### Notes

Dont hit the ground or you'll complete the circuit and get stunned for a bit. Make sure to be pulling the boom up to get out of the way.
